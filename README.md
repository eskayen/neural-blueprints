Machine learning routines from scratch

Pretty much everything I learned from MATH462/MATH463 and CS484 at George Mason University.

includes
K Nearest Neighbor
Bernoulli Naive Bayes Classifier
Perceptron w/ gradient descent and normal system
Logistic regression w/ gradient descent
K means clustering (++)
Sigmoid activation units
Dimensionality reduction with PCA and tSNE
Support Vector Machines
Neural Networks w/ back propagation
LeNet convolutional NN
